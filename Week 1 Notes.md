# L1.1 - Economic Flow
## Need for an underlying method of modeling
* Where do we start if we have to understand what companies do?
* What model do we use to interpret the data that is generated from their operations?
* What does the consumption data indicate in terms of future consumption trends?
* What does the data about trade in goods and services tell us?
We are using mathematical models to explain economic behaviour

## Trade creates value

# L1.2 Demand and Supply

Just refer ppt [[economics-intro-2.pdf]], nothing new to add in notes
## Willingness to pay - Eg with phone
* Say single customer willing to pay 8k, if any producer willing to sell below 8, then one sold
* putting this in quantity vs price graph, it will be a horizontal line until 8k
* if say another comes at 7k, then it will be a step function.
* Adding all customers demands like this will result in a demand curve
Here we get a demand according to the pricing. But for something else like say wheat there is a demand schedule.

### Demand Schedule - Consumer - Price vs demand

here basically that price and demand are inversely related

### Demand schedule - Supplier - Supply vs price

![[Pasted image 20250525011301.png]]
Positively related - supply goes here.

Putting them both in the same chart

Point where they meet is the equilibrium curve

## Effect of income
The demand curve moves up

* in some cases, it's the opposite, in which case it's called an inferior good.

Just as irrelevant. Just use your brain. This is rudimentary stuff.
